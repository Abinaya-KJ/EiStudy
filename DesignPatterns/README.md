# Design Patterns in Java

This repository demonstrates various **Design Patterns** implemented in Java with practical examples and use cases.

##  Repository Structure

###  Creational Patterns
- **Factory Method Pattern** - `VehicleManufacturingFactory.java`
  - *Use Case*: Vehicle Manufacturing System (Car, Motorcycle, Truck factories)
  - *Key Concepts*: Abstract factory, concrete factories, product hierarchy

- **Builder Pattern** - `ComputerConfigBuilder.java`
  - *Use Case*: Computer Configuration System
  - *Key Concepts*: Step-by-step object construction, fluent interface

### ðŸ”§ Structural Patterns
- **Decorator Pattern** - `CoffeeShopDecorator.java`
  - *Use Case*: Coffee Shop Ordering System
  - *Key Concepts*: Dynamic behavior addition, composition over inheritance

- **Adapter Pattern** - `MediaPlayerAdapter.java`
  - *Use Case*: Media Player System (Legacy to Modern adapter)
  - *Key Concepts*: Interface compatibility, legacy system integration

###  Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern** - `YouTubeObserverSystem.java`
  - *Use Case*: YouTube Channel Subscription System
  - *Key Concepts*: Event notification, loose coupling

- **Strategy Pattern** - `PaymentSystemStrategy.java`
  - *Use Case*: Payment Processing System
  - *Key Concepts*: Algorithm encapsulation, runtime behavior switching

##  How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE or command line

### Compilation & Execution
```bash
# Compile any pattern example
javac PatternFileName.java

# Run the example
java PatternFileName
```

### Example Commands
```bash
# Factory Pattern
javac VehicleManufacturingFactory.java
java VehicleManufacturingFactory

# Observer Pattern
javac YouTubeObserverSystem.java
java YouTubeObserverSystem

# Strategy Pattern
javac PaymentSystemStrategy.java
java PaymentSystemStrategy
```

## ðŸ“‹ Pattern Details

| Pattern | Type | Use Case | Key Benefits |
|---------|------|----------|--------------|
| Factory Method | Creational | Vehicle Manufacturing | Object creation flexibility |
| Builder | Creational | Computer Configuration | Complex object construction |
| Decorator | Structural | Coffee Shop Orders | Dynamic feature addition |
| Adapter | Structural | Media Player | Legacy system integration |
| Observer | Behavioral | YouTube Notifications | Event-driven communication |
| Strategy | Behavioral | Payment Processing | Algorithm interchangeability |
